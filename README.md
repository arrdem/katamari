**TL;DR** A file sets based build tool. In Clojure, for Clojure.

## Manifesto

Build tools are tricky things.
It's often said that the [two hardest problems in computer science are cache invalidation, naming things and off by one errors](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/506010907021828096).
Unfortunately, build tools run right smack into both of these problems.

Programmers, well adapted to wrangling complexity and pipelines, do all kinds of things when packaging and building their software.
Build systems are in the most common case mere shell scripts used to glue together programs of all kinds.
The essential problem of gluing together Unix programs is that each program could have arbitrary effects.
There's no good way to understand what configuration a task consumed, or what results it produced.

"real" build tools try to solve this problem by rendering build steps declarative, so that the declared dependency relationships can be used to derive incremental compilation behavior.
This is the approach taken by Bazel, Buck, Pants, Maven, Boot and more.

As a Twitter employee I spent a lot of...
quality time with Pants and came to appreciate the repeatability properties it provided, and its change detection facilities.
Unfortunately because Pants and friends try to be efficient general purpose solutions for many toolchains, their particular machinery is greatly complicated by the needs of those tools.
For instance Pant's Java compilation pipeline is inextricably bound to Scala's incremental compilation engine because that was a high priority for the Pants developers.
As these tools are institutional, they're thinly documented at best.
All their primary customers are internal, and cultivating an external user base is nobody's priority.

Many build tasks are honestly pretty trivial, and just get re-computed because it's more engineering effort than it's worth to write special purpose change detection machinery.
The hope of Katamari is that, by maintaining an eternal product cache and providing tools for content addressing build products, significant wins just wrapping existing tools.

## Architecture

Katamari is a two part system, consisting of a build server and a CLI client / launcher.
The client simply provides a shim for locating the server, and calling into it to provide task execution.

The server is a persistent JVM process used to amortize JVM startup costs and build graph analysis across multiple task invocations.

Katamari consumes `Rollfile`s, which provide definitions of build targets, target types and build plugins.

When the CLI client is invoked, it sends the current working directory and arguments to the server.
The server provides all task parsing, `Rollfile` location, and task execution.

For debugging, the server provides an embedded nREPL server.
